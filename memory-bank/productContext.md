# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Traditional monolithic applications become difficult to maintain, scale, and deploy as they grow. This project addresses the need to understand how microservices architecture can solve these challenges by breaking down applications into smaller, manageable services.

## User Experience Goals
- **Developers Learning Microservices**: Provide a clear, practical example of microservices implementation
- **Students**: Understand real-world application of microservices patterns
- **End Users**: Experience a blog platform with posts and comments functionality

## Core User Flows
1. **View Posts**: Users can browse and read blog posts
2. **Create Posts**: Users can create new blog posts
3. **Comment on Posts**: Users can add comments to existing posts
4. **Comment Moderation**: System automatically moderates comments based on content rules

## Value Proposition
- **Learning Value**: Hands-on experience with microservices architecture
- **Practical Application**: Real working example of event-driven microservices
- **Modern Stack**: Exposure to current industry-standard technologies
- **Best Practices**: Implementation of proper development patterns and documentation

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Developers learning microservices architecture
- **Secondary**: Students studying distributed systems
- **Tertiary**: Anyone interested in modern web development patterns

## Business Context
This is an educational project based on a microservices course. The goal is to provide practical experience with:
- Service decomposition strategies
- Inter-service communication patterns
- Event-driven architecture
- Frontend integration with multiple services
- Modern development tooling and practices

## User Stories
1. **As a learner**, I want to see how posts and comments are handled by separate services
2. **As a developer**, I want to understand how services communicate through events
3. **As a student**, I want to practice with modern React and TypeScript
4. **As a user**, I want to create posts and see comments appear in real-time
5. **As a system**, I want to automatically moderate inappropriate comments

## Success Metrics
- Successful completion of all microservices implementation
- Working inter-service communication
- Functional React frontend
- Clear understanding of microservices patterns
- Comprehensive documentation for future reference
