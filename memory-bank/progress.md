# Progress

## What Works
‚úÖ **React Client Application**
- Fully scaffolded React 19 + TypeScript + Vite application
- Modern build configuration with ESLint and TypeScript
- Development server ready on port 3000
- All dependencies properly installed and configured

‚úÖ **Project Structure**
- Clear microservices directory structure established
- Separate package.json files for each service
- Memory bank documentation system initialized
- Git repository with proper change tracking

‚úÖ **Development Environment**
- Windows PowerShell environment configured
- Node.js and npm available
- Vite development server working
- TypeScript compilation configured

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Complete memory bank system with all core files
- Updated main README with project overview and setup instructions
- Project brief, product context, system patterns documented
- Technical context and development guidelines established

‚úÖ **Posts Service Implementation** 
- Express.js TypeScript server running on port 4000
- GET /posts endpoint for retrieving all posts
- POST /posts endpoint for creating new posts
- In-memory data storage with proper typing
- TypeScript compilation to dist/ directory
- Development tooling with tsx and nodemon hot reload
- Postman collection for API testing

‚úÖ **Service Configuration**
- Posts service fully implemented with modern TypeScript setup
- Comments service package.json with dependencies and TypeScript config
- All services configured with proper module systems (CommonJS)
- Development dependencies (nodemon, TypeScript types) properly set up

## What's Partially Complete
üîÑ **Posts Service** 
- ‚úÖ Core CRUD functionality (GET/POST endpoints implemented)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript setup and compilation
- ‚úÖ Development tooling and Postman testing
- ‚è≥ CORS middleware (needed for frontend integration)
- ‚è≥ PUT/DELETE endpoints for full CRUD
- ‚è≥ Event publishing integration
- ‚è≥ Comprehensive README documentation

üîÑ **Service Implementation**
- Comments service has package.json and dependencies but no implementation code
- Event bus service not yet created
- Service-specific README files are empty and need documentation

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. **Complete Posts Service**
   - Add CORS middleware for frontend integration
   - Implement PUT/DELETE endpoints for complete CRUD
   - Add event publishing logic for inter-service communication
   - Create comprehensive README with API documentation

2. **Comments Service Implementation**
   - Express.js server setup
   - Comment CRUD endpoints
   - Comment moderation logic
   - Event handling for posts

3. **Event Bus Service**
   - Central event coordination service
   - Event routing and distribution
   - Service registration/discovery
   - Event logging

4. **Service-Specific Documentation**
   - Posts service README with API documentation
   - Comments service README with API documentation
   - Event bus service README with event schemas
   - Architecture and usage examples

### Medium Priority
5. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update React app to consume microservices
   - Create components for posts and comments
   - Implement state management
   - Add real-time updates

6. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - Implement event publishing/subscribing
   - Test service-to-service communication
   - Handle service failures gracefully
   - Add retry mechanisms

### Low Priority
7. **Advanced Features**
   - Comment moderation rules
   - Post categorization
   - User interface improvements
   - Error boundary implementation

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Active Implementation - Posts Service 80% Complete
- **Completion**: ~65% (Structure, client, documentation, and Posts service core functionality complete)
- **Next Milestone**: Complete Posts service and begin Comments service implementation
- **Blockers**: None currently identified
- **Recent Achievement**: Posts service successfully implemented with TypeScript and CRUD endpoints

## Known Issues
- Posts service README is empty and needs comprehensive API documentation
- Posts service needs CORS middleware for frontend integration
- Posts service missing PUT/DELETE endpoints for complete CRUD
- Comments service exists as package.json only, no actual implementation code
- No inter-service communication established yet
- Frontend still shows default Vite template and needs microservices integration

## Evolution of Decisions
- **Module System**: Decided on CommonJS for services, ES modules for client
- **Documentation Strategy**: Implemented memory bank system for comprehensive tracking
- **Technology Choices**: Stuck with modern stack (React 19, TypeScript, Vite)
- **Learning Focus**: Prioritizing educational value over production readiness

## Success Metrics Progress
- ‚úÖ Project structure established
- ‚úÖ React frontend scaffolded
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation system created
- ‚úÖ Main README with complete project overview
- ‚úÖ Posts service core implementation with TypeScript and Express.js
- üîÑ Posts service CRUD operations (GET/POST complete, PUT/DELETE pending)
- ‚è≥ Inter-service communication pending
- ‚è≥ Event-driven architecture pending

## Next Session Goals
1. Add CORS middleware to Posts service for frontend integration
2. Implement PUT/DELETE endpoints to complete Posts CRUD operations
3. Create comprehensive Posts service README with API documentation
4. Begin Comments service implementation following Posts service pattern
5. Plan Event Bus service architecture and event schemas
