# Progress

## What Works
‚úÖ **React Client Application**
- Fully scaffolded React 19 + TypeScript + Vite application
- Modern build configuration with ESLint and TypeScript
- Development server ready on port 3000
- All dependencies properly installed and configured

‚úÖ **Project Structure**
- Clear microservices directory structure established
- Separate package.json files for each service
- Memory bank documentation system initialized
- Git repository with proper change tracking

‚úÖ **Development Environment**
- Windows PowerShell environment configured
- Node.js and npm available
- Vite development server working
- TypeScript compilation configured

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Complete memory bank system with all core files
- Updated main README with project overview and setup instructions
- Project brief, product context, system patterns documented
- Technical context and development guidelines established

‚úÖ **Service Configuration**
- Posts service package.json with dependencies and TypeScript config
- Comments service package.json with dependencies and TypeScript config
- All services configured with proper module systems (CommonJS)
- Development dependencies (nodemon, TypeScript types) properly set up

## What's Partially Complete
üîÑ **Service Implementation**
- Posts service has package.json and dependencies but no implementation code
- Comments service has package.json and dependencies but no implementation code
- Event bus service not yet created
- Service-specific README files are empty and need documentation

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. **Posts Service Implementation**
   - Express.js server setup
   - CRUD endpoints for posts
   - Event publishing logic
   - Health check endpoint

2. **Comments Service Implementation**
   - Express.js server setup
   - Comment CRUD endpoints
   - Comment moderation logic
   - Event handling for posts

3. **Event Bus Service**
   - Central event coordination service
   - Event routing and distribution
   - Service registration/discovery
   - Event logging

4. **Service-Specific Documentation**
   - Posts service README with API documentation
   - Comments service README with API documentation
   - Event bus service README with event schemas
   - Architecture and usage examples

### Medium Priority
5. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update React app to consume microservices
   - Create components for posts and comments
   - Implement state management
   - Add real-time updates

6. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - Implement event publishing/subscribing
   - Test service-to-service communication
   - Handle service failures gracefully
   - Add retry mechanisms

### Low Priority
7. **Advanced Features**
   - Comment moderation rules
   - Post categorization
   - User interface improvements
   - Error boundary implementation

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Documentation Complete, Implementation Phase
- **Completion**: ~50% (Structure, client, and documentation complete)
- **Next Milestone**: Complete all service implementations and inter-service communication
- **Blockers**: None currently identified

## Known Issues
- Service README files are empty and need API documentation
- Services exist as package.json only, no actual implementation code
- No inter-service communication established yet
- Frontend still shows default Vite template and needs microservices integration

## Evolution of Decisions
- **Module System**: Decided on CommonJS for services, ES modules for client
- **Documentation Strategy**: Implemented memory bank system for comprehensive tracking
- **Technology Choices**: Stuck with modern stack (React 19, TypeScript, Vite)
- **Learning Focus**: Prioritizing educational value over production readiness

## Success Metrics Progress
- ‚úÖ Project structure established
- ‚úÖ React frontend scaffolded
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation system created
- ‚úÖ Main README with complete project overview
- ‚è≥ Service implementations in progress
- ‚è≥ Inter-service communication pending
- ‚è≥ Event-driven architecture pending

## Next Session Goals
1. Implement Posts service with Express.js and basic CRUD endpoints
2. Implement Comments service with Express.js and comment management
3. Create Event Bus service for inter-service communication
4. Update service README files with API documentation
5. Test basic service startup and health checks
