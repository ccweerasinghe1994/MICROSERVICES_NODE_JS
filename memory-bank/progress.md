- Full component architecture: CreatePost, PostList, PostItem, CommentList, CommentCreate
- Real-time state management for posts and comments
- CORS-enabled communication with backend services

‚úÖ **Project Structure**
- Clear microservices directory structure established
- Separate package.json files for each service
- Memory bank documentation system initialized
- Git repository with proper change tracking

‚úÖ **Development Environment**
- Windows PowerShell environment configured
- Node.js and npm available
- Vite development server working
- TypeScript compilation configured

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Complete memory bank system with all core files
- Updated main README with project overview and setup instructions
- Project brief, product context, system patterns documented
- Technical context and development guidelines established

‚úÖ **Posts Service Implementation** 
- Express.js TypeScript server running on port 4000 with CORS enabled
- GET /posts endpoint for retrieving all posts
- POST /posts endpoint for creating new posts
- In-memory data storage with proper typing
- TypeScript compilation to dist/ directory
- Development tooling with tsx and nodemon hot reload
- Postman collection for API testing

‚úÖ **Comments Service Implementation**
- Express.js TypeScript server running on port 4001 with CORS enabled
- GET /posts/:id/comments endpoint for retrieving comments by post ID
- POST /posts/:id/comments endpoint for creating new comments
- Proper TypeScript interfaces moved to separate declaration file
- In-memory data storage organized by post ID
- CORS middleware for frontend integration

‚úÖ **Service Configuration**
- Both Posts and Comments services fully implemented with modern TypeScript setup
- All services configured with proper module systems (CommonJS)
- CORS enabled for frontend integration
- Development dependencies (nodemon, TypeScript types) properly set up

## What's Partially Complete
üîÑ **Frontend-Backend Integration** 
- ‚úÖ Posts and Comments services fully functional with CORS
- ‚úÖ React client completely transformed with full UI/UX
- ‚úÖ API layer with proper error handling and TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Real-time state management for posts and comments
- ‚è≥ Event-driven communication between services
- ‚è≥ Comment moderation functionality
- ‚è≥ Advanced error boundaries and user feedback

üîÑ **Project Documentation**
- ‚úÖ Memory bank system complete and up to date
- ‚úÖ Main README with comprehensive project information
- ‚è≥ Service-specific README files for Posts and Comments APIs
- ‚è≥ API documentation with endpoint examples

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. **Event Bus Service Implementation**
   - Create central event coordination service
   - Implement event routing and distribution
   - Add service registration/discovery
   - Enable real-time communication between services

2. **Enhanced Service Features**
   - Add comment moderation logic to Comments service
   - Implement PUT/DELETE endpoints for complete CRUD operations
   - Add event publishing logic for inter-service communication
   - Create health check endpoints for all services
   - Event handling for posts

3. **Event Bus Service**
   - Central event coordination service
   - Event routing and distribution
   - Service registration/discovery
   - Event logging

4. **Service-Specific Documentation**
   - Posts service README with API documentation
   - Comments service README with API documentation
   - Event bus service README with event schemas
   - Architecture and usage examples

### Medium Priority
5. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update React app to consume microservices
   - Create components for posts and comments
   - Implement state management
   - Add real-time updates

6. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - Implement event publishing/subscribing
   - Test service-to-service communication
   - Handle service failures gracefully
   - Add retry mechanisms

### Low Priority
7. **Advanced Features**
   - Comment moderation rules
   - Post categorization
   - User interface improvements
   - Error boundary implementation

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Major Implementation Complete - Core Microservices Functional
- **Completion**: ~85% (Structure, documentation, Posts/Comments services, and client application complete)
- **Next Milestone**: Implement Event Bus service and complete inter-service communication
- **Blockers**: None currently identified
- **Recent Achievement**: Complete transformation - functional microservices application with frontend integration

## Known Issues
- Posts and Comments service README files are empty and need comprehensive API documentation
- Event Bus service not yet implemented
- No event-driven inter-service communication established yet
- Comment moderation logic not yet implemented
- Missing PUT/DELETE endpoints for complete CRUD operations

## Evolution of Decisions
- **Module System**: Decided on CommonJS for services, ES modules for client
- **Documentation Strategy**: Implemented memory bank system for comprehensive tracking
- **Technology Choices**: Stuck with modern stack (React 19, TypeScript, Vite)
- **Learning Focus**: Prioritizing educational value over production readiness

## Success Metrics Progress
- ‚úÖ Project structure established
- ‚úÖ React frontend completely transformed with microservices integration
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation system created
- ‚úÖ Main README with complete project overview
- ‚úÖ Posts service fully implemented with TypeScript, Express.js, and CORS
- ‚úÖ Comments service fully implemented with TypeScript, Express.js, and CORS
- ‚úÖ Frontend-backend integration with real-time state management
- ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS styling and modern UI/UX
- üîÑ Inter-service communication (direct HTTP, event bus pending)
- ‚è≥ Event-driven architecture pending

## Next Session Goals
1. Implement Event Bus service for inter-service communication
2. Add event publishing logic to Posts and Comments services
3. Implement comment moderation functionality
4. Create comprehensive API documentation for Posts and Comments services
5. Add PUT/DELETE endpoints for complete CRUD operations
