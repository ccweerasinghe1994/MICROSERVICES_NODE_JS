# Progress

## What Works
‚úÖ **React Client Application**
- Fully scaffolded React 19 + TypeScript + Vite application
- Modern build configuration with ESLint and TypeScript
- Development server ready on port 3000
- All dependencies properly installed and configured

‚úÖ **Project Structure**
- Clear microservices directory structure established
- Separate package.json files for each service
- Memory bank documentation system initialized
- Git repository with proper change tracking

‚úÖ **Development Environment**
- Windows PowerShell environment configured
- Node.js and npm available
- Vite development server working
- TypeScript compilation configured

## What's Partially Complete
üîÑ **Service Configuration**
- Posts service package.json created but no implementation
- Comments service package.json created but no implementation
- Event bus service not yet created
- README files exist but are empty

üîÑ **Documentation**
- Memory bank structure established
- Core documentation files created
- Service-specific documentation pending
- API documentation needs to be written

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. **Posts Service Implementation**
   - Express.js server setup
   - CRUD endpoints for posts
   - Event publishing logic
   - Health check endpoint

2. **Comments Service Implementation**
   - Express.js server setup
   - Comment CRUD endpoints
   - Comment moderation logic
   - Event handling for posts

3. **Event Bus Service**
   - Central event coordination service
   - Event routing and distribution
   - Service registration/discovery
   - Event logging

4. **README Documentation**
   - Main project README with setup instructions
   - Posts service API documentation
   - Comments service API documentation
   - Architecture and usage examples

### Medium Priority
5. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update React app to consume microservices
   - Create components for posts and comments
   - Implement state management
   - Add real-time updates

6. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - Implement event publishing/subscribing
   - Test service-to-service communication
   - Handle service failures gracefully
   - Add retry mechanisms

### Low Priority
7. **Advanced Features**
   - Comment moderation rules
   - Post categorization
   - User interface improvements
   - Error boundary implementation

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Initial Setup and Documentation
- **Completion**: ~25% (Structure and client setup complete)
- **Next Milestone**: Complete all service implementations
- **Blockers**: None currently identified

## Known Issues
- README files are empty and need comprehensive documentation
- Services exist as package.json only, no actual implementation
- No inter-service communication established yet
- Frontend still shows default Vite template

## Evolution of Decisions
- **Module System**: Decided on CommonJS for services, ES modules for client
- **Documentation Strategy**: Implemented memory bank system for comprehensive tracking
- **Technology Choices**: Stuck with modern stack (React 19, TypeScript, Vite)
- **Learning Focus**: Prioritizing educational value over production readiness

## Success Metrics Progress
- ‚úÖ Project structure established
- ‚úÖ React frontend scaffolded
- ‚è≥ Service implementations in progress
- ‚è≥ Documentation being written
- ‚è≥ Inter-service communication pending
- ‚è≥ Event-driven architecture pending

## Next Session Goals
1. Complete README documentation for all services
2. Implement basic Posts service with Express.js
3. Implement basic Comments service with Express.js
4. Create Event Bus service
5. Test basic service communication
