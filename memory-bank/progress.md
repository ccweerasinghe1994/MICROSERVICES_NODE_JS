- GET /posts endpoint serving aggregated data to frontend
- Strong TypeScript typing with proper event and data interfaces
- CORS enabled for frontend consumption

‚úÖ **Moderation Service Scaffolding**
- Basic Express.js TypeScript server running on port 4003
- Event endpoint configured to receive events
- Package.json, tsconfig.json, and dependencies configured
- Prettier formatting configuration
- Ready for moderation logic implementation

‚úÖ **Event-Driven Architecture Foundation**
- Comments service emitting CommentCreated events to event bus
- Query service consuming events to build aggregated read models
- Event schemas defined with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Event bus receiving and distributing events between services

‚úÖ **Code Quality and Consistency**
- Prettier configuration added to all services (.prettierrc files)
- Consistent code formatting across client and all backend services
- TypeScript strict typing enforced throughout the codebase
- Proper error handling and type safety maintained

## What's Partially Complete
üîÑ **Event-Driven Communication**
- ‚úÖ Comments service emitting events to event bus
- ‚úÖ Query service consuming events for data aggregation
- ‚úÖ Frontend consuming aggregated data from query service
- ‚è≥ Moderation service event handling logic
- ‚è≥ Comment status update events from moderation to query service
- ‚è≥ Posts service event emission for PostCreated events

üîÑ **Moderation Service**
- ‚úÖ Basic Express.js server scaffolded and running on port 4003
- ‚úÖ Event endpoint configured to receive events
- ‚úÖ TypeScript configuration and dependencies set up
- ‚è≥ Actual comment moderation logic implementation
- ‚è≥ Comment status update event emission
- ‚è≥ Integration with query service for status updates

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. **Complete Moderation Service Logic**
   - Implement actual comment content moderation (currently only logs events)
   - Add moderation rules (keyword filtering, etc.)
   - Emit CommentModerated events with approved/rejected status
   - Send status updates back to query service

2. **Enhanced Event-Driven Features**
   - Add PostCreated event emission from posts service  
   - Implement complete event propagation flow
   - Add event handling resilience and error recovery
   - Create event replay capability for query service state reconstruction

3. **Complete CRUD Operations**
   - Add PUT/DELETE endpoints for posts and comments
   - Implement comment status updates via moderation events
   - Add event handling for update and delete operations
   - Ensure query service handles all event types

4. **Service Documentation**
   - Query service README with event schemas and API documentation
   - Moderation service README with moderation rules and event flow
   - Updated Posts and Comments service READMEs with event publishing details
   - Event flow diagrams and architecture documentation

### Medium Priority
5. **Error Handling and Resilience**
   - Event publishing failure handling
   - Service timeout and retry mechanisms
   - Dead letter queue for failed events
   - Health check endpoints for all services

6. **Advanced Event Features**
   - Event versioning and schema evolution
   - Event store implementation for better persistence
   - Event sourcing for complete state reconstruction
   - Event bus enhancement with better routing
   - Implement state management
   - Add real-time updates

6. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - Implement event publishing/subscribing
   - Test service-to-service communication
   - Handle service failures gracefully
   - Add retry mechanisms

### Low Priority
7. **Advanced Frontend Features**
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
   - Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability
   - Advanced error boundaries with retry functionality
   - Loading states and better UX for async operations

8. **Production Readiness**
   - Service containerization with Docker
   - Environment configuration management
   - Logging and monitoring setup
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Advanced Implementation - Event-Driven Architecture in Progress
- **Completion**: ~75% (All core services implemented, event-driven foundation established, query service operational)
- **Next Milestone**: Complete moderation service logic and full event propagation flow
- **Blockers**: None currently identified
- **Recent Achievement**: Successfully implemented CQRS pattern with query service and event-driven comment creation

## Known Issues
- Moderation service only logs events, needs actual moderation logic
- Posts service not yet emitting PostCreated events
- Query service lacks event replay capability for state reconstruction
- Missing PUT/DELETE operations for complete CRUD functionality
- Service-specific documentation needs updates to reflect event-driven changes

## Evolution of Decisions
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Adopted CQRS pattern with separate query service for read operations
- **Data Flow Strategy**: Moved from direct service calls to event-driven aggregated data consumption
- **Frontend Integration**: Refactored to consume aggregated data from query service instead of multiple service calls
- **Module System**: Maintained CommonJS for services, ES modules for client
- **Code Quality**: Implemented Prettier formatting across all services for consistency

## Success Metrics Progress
- ‚úÖ Project structure established with all core services
- ‚úÖ React frontend refactored for event-driven data consumption
- ‚úÖ CQRS pattern implemented with query service
- ‚úÖ Event-driven communication foundation established
- ‚úÖ Comments service enhanced with event emission
- ‚úÖ Query service aggregating data from events
- ‚úÖ Moderation service scaffolded and ready for implementation
- ‚úÖ Code consistency with Prettier formatting
- üîÑ Full event propagation flow (comments working, posts pending)
- ‚è≥ Complete moderation workflow implementation

## Next Session Goals
1. Complete moderation service logic with actual comment filtering
2. Add PostCreated event emission from posts service
3. Implement comment status update events from moderation service
4. Add PUT/DELETE endpoints for complete CRUD operations
5. Create comprehensive API and event documentation for all services
6. Add event replay capability to query service for state reconstruction
