# Active Context

## Current Focus
Major breakthrough in project implementation! Both Posts and Comments services are now fully functional with CORS enabled. The React frontend has been completely transformed from a default Vite template into a fully functional microservices client with Tailwind CSS styling, comprehensive API integration, and complete CRUD functionality for posts and comments.

## Recent Changes
- **Complete Comments Service Implementation**: Created TypeScript Express.js server with GET/POST endpoints for comments
- **CORS Integration**: Added CORS middleware to both Posts and Comments services for frontend integration
- **Frontend Transformation**: Complete overhaul of React client from Vite template to functional microservices app
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Added Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive styling
- **API Layer Architecture**: Created comprehensive API methods with proper error handling and TypeScript types
- **Component Architecture**: Built complete component structure with PostList, PostItem, CommentList, CommentCreate
- **Real-time Updates**: Implemented state management for real-time post and comment creation
- **Type Safety**: Moved all API types to separate types.ts file for better organization
- **Development Tooling**: Added Prettier for code formatting and consistent development practices

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create Event Bus Service**: Implement central event coordination service for inter-service communication
2. **Add Event Publishing**: Integrate event publishing to Posts and Comments services
3. **Implement Comment Moderation**: Add automatic content moderation to Comments service
4. **Service Documentation**: Create comprehensive README files for Posts and Comments services
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error boundaries and user feedback in the frontend

## Key Decisions Made
- **Module System**: Using CommonJS for Node.js services, ES modules for React client
- **Technology Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite for frontend, Express.js for services
- **Port Allocation**: Client:3000, Posts:4000, Comments:4001, Event Bus:4005
- **Documentation Strategy**: Comprehensive README files for each component

## Current File States
- **Main README**: Completely updated with comprehensive project documentation and setup instructions
- **Memory Bank**: All core files created and populated with detailed project context
- **Posts Service**: ✅ Fully functional Express.js server with TypeScript, CORS, GET/POST endpoints, and Postman collection
- **Comments Service**: ✅ Fully functional Express.js server with TypeScript, CORS, and GET/POST endpoints for comments
- **Client Application**: ✅ Complete transformation with Tailwind CSS, API integration, and full CRUD functionality
- **Git Configuration**: Proper .gitignore files and GitHub Copilot instructions added

## Active Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation-First**: Creating thorough documentation before implementation
- **Service Isolation**: Each service has its own directory and package.json
- **Modern Tooling**: Using latest versions of React, TypeScript, and build tools
- **Educational Focus**: Prioritizing learning and understanding over production concerns

## Important Considerations
- This is a learning project, so emphasize clarity and educational value
- Use in-memory storage for simplicity
- Focus on microservices patterns rather than production concerns
- Maintain clean separation between services
- Document API endpoints and event schemas clearly

## Development Environment Notes
- Windows development environment with PowerShell
- Using npm as package manager
- Vite for fast frontend development
- Express.js for lightweight service implementation

## Learning Objectives in Progress
- Understanding microservices decomposition
- Implementing event-driven communication
- Practicing modern React with TypeScript
- Learning service-to-service communication patterns
