# Active Context

## Current Focus
ðŸŽ‰ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Complete event-driven microservices architecture now functional! The moderation service has been fully implemented with actual comment filtering logic and CommentModerated event emission. The entire event flow is now working: Comments â†’ Event Bus â†’ Moderation â†’ Event Bus â†’ Query Service, demonstrating a complete CQRS pattern with automated comment moderation workflow.

## Recent Changes
- **ðŸš€ Moderation Service Complete**: Fully implemented comment moderation logic with keyword filtering ("orange" rejection rule)
- **Event Bus Enhancement**: Now properly routing events to all services including moderation service (port 4003)
- **CommentModerated Events**: Moderation service now emits CommentModerated events back to event bus with approved/rejected status
- **TypeScript Type Safety**: Added comprehensive types.ts file to moderation service for event handling
- **Complete Event Flow**: End-to-end event-driven communication working across all services
- **Code Quality**: Improved formatting and structure in event bus service

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Query Service Event Handling**: Update query service to handle CommentModerated events and update comment status
2. **Frontend Status Display**: Show comment approval/rejection status in the UI
3. **Posts Event Integration**: Add PostCreated event emission from posts service to complete the flow
4. **Enhanced Moderation Rules**: Expand beyond simple keyword filtering to more sophisticated rules
5. **Error Handling**: Add resilience for failed event publishing and network issues

## Key Decisions Made
- **Complete Event-Driven Architecture**: Full CQRS implementation with automated moderation workflow
- **Moderation Strategy**: Simple keyword-based filtering with "orange" as rejection trigger (expandable)
- **Event Schema**: CommentCreated â†’ CommentModerated event flow with status updates
- **Port Allocation**: All services operational - Client:3000, Posts:4000, Comments:4001, Query:4002, Moderation:4003, Event Bus:4005
- **Event Flow**: Comments â†’ Event Bus â†’ Moderation â†’ Event Bus â†’ Query (complete pipeline)

## Current File States
- **Posts Service**: âœ… Fully functional (pending PostCreated event integration)
- **Comments Service**: âœ… Complete with event emission to event bus
- **Query Service**: âœ… Aggregating data from CommentCreated events (needs CommentModerated handling)
- **Moderation Service**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Full comment moderation with CommentModerated event emission
- **Event Bus**: âœ… **ENHANCED** - Routing events to all services including moderation
- **Client Application**: âœ… Consuming aggregated data (needs status display updates)
- **TypeScript Types**: âœ… Comprehensive typing across all services

## Active Patterns and Preferences
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate via events rather than direct HTTP calls
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separating command operations (posts/comments services) from query operations (query service)
- **Service Isolation**: Each service maintains its own data and responsibilities
- **Aggregated Data Views**: Query service provides optimized read views by aggregating event data
- **Status Tracking**: Comments include status fields for moderation workflow
- **Code Consistency**: Prettier formatting enforced across all services

## Important Considerations
- Event-driven architecture introduces eventual consistency
- Query service rebuilds state from events (event sourcing lite)
- Comment status workflow: pending â†’ approved/rejected
- All services should handle event failures gracefully
- Maintain clear event schemas for inter-service communication

## Development Environment Notes
- Windows development environment with PowerShell
- Using npm/pnpm as package managers
- Vite for fast frontend development
- Express.js with tsx/nodemon for backend hot reload
- TypeScript compilation for type safety across services

## Learning Objectives in Progress
- Understanding CQRS and event sourcing patterns
- Implementing event-driven microservices communication  
- Managing eventual consistency in distributed systems
- Practicing modern React with aggregated data consumption
- Learning service decomposition and inter-service event schemas
