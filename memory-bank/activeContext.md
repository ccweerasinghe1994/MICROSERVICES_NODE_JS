# Active Context

## Current Focus
🎉 **COMPLETE MICROSERVICES ECOSYSTEM WITH CONTAINERIZATION**: The entire event-driven microservices architecture is now fully operational with enterprise-level patterns. All services are complete with comprehensive event-driven communication, event sourcing, real-time synchronization, automated comment moderation workflow, and **Docker containerization** for deployment-ready infrastructure.

## Recent Changes
- **🐳 Docker Containerization Complete**: Posts service fully dockerized with pnpm optimization and production builds
- **🎉 pnpm Integration**: Updated Posts service to use pnpm for better dependency management and performance
- **🎉 Container Development Workflow**: Volume mounts for hot reload, multi-stage builds, and container management scripts
- **🎉 Complete Event-Driven Architecture**: All services fully integrated with event bus communication
- **🎉 Posts Service Events**: PostCreated events fully implemented and working with query service
- **🎉 Comments Service Complete**: Full CommentCreated → CommentModerated → CommentUpdated event lifecycle operational
- **🎉 Query Service Event Sourcing**: Handles all event types (PostCreated, CommentCreated, CommentUpdated) with startup replay
- **🎉 Moderation Service Operational**: Complete keyword-based comment filtering with CommentModerated events
- **🎉 Event Bus Enterprise-Level**: Event storage, GET /events endpoint, and comprehensive error handling
- **🎉 TypeScript Type System**: Complete type safety across all event schemas and service interfaces
- **🎉 Moderation Service Operational**: Complete keyword-based comment filtering with CommentModerated events
- **🎉 Event Bus Enterprise-Level**: Event storage, GET /events endpoint, and comprehensive error handling
- **🎉 TypeScript Type System**: Complete type safety across all event schemas and service interfaces

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Containerize Remaining Services**: Docker setup for Comments, Query, Moderation, and Event Bus services
2. **Docker Compose Orchestration**: Complete multi-service Docker Compose setup for entire ecosystem
3. **Frontend Real-Time Updates**: Implement status display for approved/rejected comments in the UI
4. **Advanced Error Recovery**: Implement retry mechanisms and dead letter queues
5. **Performance Optimization**: Add event batching and efficient state management
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for the complete event-driven workflow

## Key Decisions Made
- **🏆 Complete Event Sourcing**: Event bus stores all events with replay capability for state reconstruction
- **🐳 Docker-First Development**: Posts service containerized with pnpm optimization and multi-stage builds
- **Complete Event-Driven Flow**: PostCreated → CommentCreated → CommentModerated → CommentUpdated lifecycle
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: All services maintain synchronized state through event propagation
- **Query Service Event Replay**: Automatic state reconstruction on startup from complete event history
- **Enterprise Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for failed service communications
- **Keyword-Based Moderation**: Simple yet effective content filtering (expandable to complex rules)
- **CQRS Pattern Implementation**: Clear separation between command and query operations
- **pnpm Package Management**: Superior dependency management with better performance and disk efficiency

## Current File States
- **Posts Service**: ✅ **CONTAINERIZED** - Full CRUD operations with PostCreated events + Docker/pnpm optimization
- **Comments Service**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Handles CommentModerated events and emits CommentUpdated events (needs containerization)
- **Query Service**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Handles all event types with comprehensive event replay capability (needs containerization)
- **Moderation Service**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Full comment moderation with CommentModerated event emission (needs containerization)
- **Event Bus**: ✅ **ENTERPRISE-LEVEL** - Event storage, replay, and comprehensive error handling (needs containerization)
- **Client Application**: ✅ **FUNCTIONAL** - Consuming aggregated data (ready for status display updates)
- **TypeScript System**: ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE** - Complete type safety across all event schemas
- **Docker Infrastructure**: 🔄 **PARTIAL** - Posts service fully containerized, other services pending

## Active Patterns and Preferences
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate via events rather than direct HTTP calls
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separating command operations (posts/comments services) from query operations (query service)
- **Service Isolation**: Each service maintains its own data and responsibilities
- **Aggregated Data Views**: Query service provides optimized read views by aggregating event data
- **Status Tracking**: Comments include status fields for moderation workflow
- **Code Consistency**: Prettier formatting enforced across all services

## Important Considerations
- Event-driven architecture introduces eventual consistency
- Query service rebuilds state from events (event sourcing lite)
- Comment status workflow: pending → approved/rejected
- All services should handle event failures gracefully
- Maintain clear event schemas for inter-service communication

## Development Environment Notes
- Windows development environment with PowerShell
- Using **pnpm** as primary package manager for better performance and dependency management
- Docker Desktop for container development and deployment
- Vite for fast frontend development
- Express.js with tsx/nodemon for backend hot reload
- TypeScript compilation for type safety across services
- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized production containers

## Learning Objectives in Progress
- Understanding CQRS and event sourcing patterns
- Implementing event-driven microservices communication  
- Managing eventual consistency in distributed systems
- Practicing modern React with aggregated data consumption
- Learning service decomposition and inter-service event schemas
