# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project has fully completed the documentation and setup phase. All memory bank files are comprehensive and up-to-date, the main README provides complete project overview, and the React client is fully scaffolded. The project is now ready to move into the implementation phase, starting with the backend microservices.

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Review**: All core documentation files reviewed and confirmed current
- **No Code Changes**: No new changes detected in the project since last update
- **Documentation Consistency**: All memory bank files align with current project state
- **README Accuracy**: Main README reflects current status and complete setup instructions
- **Project Stability**: All configurations and dependencies remain properly set up

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Implement Posts Service**: Create the Express.js server with CRUD endpoints and basic functionality
2. **Implement Comments Service**: Create the Express.js server with comment management and moderation
3. **Create Event Bus Service**: Implement the central event coordination service
4. **Update Client Application**: Modify React app to consume microservices and remove default template
5. **Test Inter-Service Communication**: Verify event-driven communication between services

## Key Decisions Made
- **Module System**: Using CommonJS for Node.js services, ES modules for React client
- **Technology Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite for frontend, Express.js for services
- **Port Allocation**: Client:3000, Posts:4000, Comments:4001, Event Bus:4005
- **Documentation Strategy**: Comprehensive README files for each component

## Current File States
- **Main README**: Completely updated with comprehensive project documentation and setup instructions
- **Memory Bank**: All core files created and populated with detailed project context
- **Posts Service**: Package.json with dependencies, TypeScript config, empty README (needs implementation)
- **Comments Service**: Package.json with dependencies, TypeScript config, empty README (needs implementation)
- **Client**: Fully scaffolded React TypeScript application with Vite (ready for customization)
- **Git Configuration**: Proper .gitignore files and GitHub Copilot instructions added

## Active Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation-First**: Creating thorough documentation before implementation
- **Service Isolation**: Each service has its own directory and package.json
- **Modern Tooling**: Using latest versions of React, TypeScript, and build tools
- **Educational Focus**: Prioritizing learning and understanding over production concerns

## Important Considerations
- This is a learning project, so emphasize clarity and educational value
- Use in-memory storage for simplicity
- Focus on microservices patterns rather than production concerns
- Maintain clean separation between services
- Document API endpoints and event schemas clearly

## Development Environment Notes
- Windows development environment with PowerShell
- Using npm as package manager
- Vite for fast frontend development
- Express.js for lightweight service implementation

## Learning Objectives in Progress
- Understanding microservices decomposition
- Implementing event-driven communication
- Practicing modern React with TypeScript
- Learning service-to-service communication patterns
