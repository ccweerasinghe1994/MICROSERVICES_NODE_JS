# Active Context

## Current Focus
Significant progress has been made on the Posts service implementation! The service now has a fully functional Express.js server with TypeScript, CRUD endpoints for posts, and proper development tooling. The project is actively moving through the implementation phase with the Posts service nearing completion.

## Recent Changes
- **Posts Service Implementation**: Created TypeScript Express.js server with GET/POST endpoints for posts
- **Development Tooling**: Added tsx, nodemon dev script for hot reload development
- **Project Structure**: Added src/ directory with index.ts main file, dist/ for compiled output
- **API Testing**: Added Postman collection and environment for Posts service testing
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Posts service now compiles to JavaScript with source maps
- **Dependencies**: Using modern stack with Express 5.x, TypeScript 5.x, and proper typing

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete Posts Service**: Add CORS middleware, update/delete endpoints, and comprehensive README documentation
2. **Event Bus Integration**: Add event publishing to Posts service for inter-service communication
3. **Implement Comments Service**: Create similar Express.js server structure with comment management
4. **Create Event Bus Service**: Implement the central event coordination service
5. **Service Documentation**: Update Posts README with API documentation and usage examples

## Key Decisions Made
- **Module System**: Using CommonJS for Node.js services, ES modules for React client
- **Technology Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite for frontend, Express.js for services
- **Port Allocation**: Client:3000, Posts:4000, Comments:4001, Event Bus:4005
- **Documentation Strategy**: Comprehensive README files for each component

## Current File States
- **Main README**: Completely updated with comprehensive project documentation and setup instructions
- **Memory Bank**: All core files created and populated with detailed project context
- **Posts Service**: âœ… Fully functional Express.js server with TypeScript, GET/POST endpoints, dev tooling, and Postman collection
- **Comments Service**: Package.json with dependencies, TypeScript config, empty README (implementation pending)
- **Client**: Fully scaffolded React TypeScript application with Vite (ready for customization)
- **Git Configuration**: Proper .gitignore files and GitHub Copilot instructions added

## Active Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation-First**: Creating thorough documentation before implementation
- **Service Isolation**: Each service has its own directory and package.json
- **Modern Tooling**: Using latest versions of React, TypeScript, and build tools
- **Educational Focus**: Prioritizing learning and understanding over production concerns

## Important Considerations
- This is a learning project, so emphasize clarity and educational value
- Use in-memory storage for simplicity
- Focus on microservices patterns rather than production concerns
- Maintain clean separation between services
- Document API endpoints and event schemas clearly

## Development Environment Notes
- Windows development environment with PowerShell
- Using npm as package manager
- Vite for fast frontend development
- Express.js for lightweight service implementation

## Learning Objectives in Progress
- Understanding microservices decomposition
- Implementing event-driven communication
- Practicing modern React with TypeScript
- Learning service-to-service communication patterns
