# Project Brief

## Core Purpose
A mini microservices application demonstrating modern microservices architecture patterns using React, TypeScript, and Node.js. This is a learning project focused on understanding microservices design, inter-service communication, and event-driven architecture.

## Primary Objectives
1. **Learn Microservices Architecture**: Understand how to break down a monolithic application into smaller, independent services
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Implement communication between services using an event bus pattern
3. **Frontend Integration**: Build a React TypeScript frontend that consumes multiple microservices
4. **Best Practices**: Apply modern development practices including TypeScript, ESLint, and proper project structure

## Scope Definition
- **Posts Service**: Microservice for managing blog posts (CRUD operations)
- **Comments Service**: Microservice for managing comments with moderation features
- **Event Bus**: Central communication hub for inter-service events
- **Client Application**: React TypeScript frontend for user interaction
- **Learning Focus**: Educational project with comprehensive documentation

## Key Constraints
- **Educational Focus**: This is a learning project, not production-ready
- **Simplified Architecture**: Using in-memory storage for demonstration
- **Modern Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite
- **Development Environment**: Windows-based development setup

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully implement all microservices with proper separation of concerns
2. Establish reliable inter-service communication via event bus
3. Create a functional React frontend that integrates with all services
4. Maintain comprehensive documentation for learning purposes
5. Demonstrate understanding of microservices patterns and practices

## Non-Goals
- Production deployment
- Database persistence (using in-memory for simplicity)
- Advanced authentication/authorization
- Performance optimization
- Scalability considerations beyond basic microservices patterns
